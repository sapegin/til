# Making a header with menu items on each side using CSS Grid

[My new siteâ€™s design](https://sapegin.me/) has this header:

![Header on my site](../images/header-menu.png)

The tricky part is to show half of the menu items on the left side of the logo, and half on the right side. All the tutorials I could find suggest to render the logo between the menu items, which requires to split the menu into two parts, and semantically wrong.

I wanted to find an accessible implementation, and I think I managed to do it.
